_Is the project currently delpoyed on Netlify? ..._

**I have followed instructions in Blackboard and various YouTube videos** 

_I have only changed the main.js code.  All other code is written by Dave Gray: awesome guy!._

This is my attempt at coding the final project, but TBH I spent to much time watching "Alya Sometimes Hides Her Feelings in Russian" and on a beach.  

I am okay with that.
